I am a PhD student at MIT in the Network Coding and Reliable Communications group under Dr. Muriel Medard. My current research focuses on network coding as an alternative to ARQ and Hybrid ARQ in 5G cellular networks. I enjoy finding elegant mathematical solutions to real-world problems in computers and communications. I have experience in C/C++, Python, Java, Matlab, Android Studio, and GNU Radio. Past research and work experiences focused on digital communications, wireless networks, and signal processing. -->
